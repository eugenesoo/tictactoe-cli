# tictactoe-cli
why play tictactoe anywhere else - when you can play it in the COMMAND LINE.

## instructions
Not much, really.
- copy the code from index.js to chrome's inspector tool (lol).
- run it.
- create a new game via `const gameName = new TicTacToe(player1Name, player2Name)`

## how to make a move (in tictactoe, not in real life)
- `gameName.makeMove(rowIndex, colIndex);`

## how to quit game
- alt-f4

plz feel free to fork it and make it into another social media app, or something.
