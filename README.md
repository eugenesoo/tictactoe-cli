# tictactoe-cli
why play tictactoe anywhere else - when you can play it in the COMMAND LINE.

## instructions
Not much, really. 
- run node index.js

## how to make a move (in tictactoe, not in real life)
- type `move`

## how to quit game
- ctrl-c or type `exit`

## other commands
- `start` to start game

plz feel free to fork it and make it into another social media app, or something.
